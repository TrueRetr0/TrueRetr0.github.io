    <div id="text-container">
      <p>Hey! Welcome to my personal webpage. My name is Kiaan Iyer. Ever since I was young, I have always had dreams of becoming a professional developer one day. My father, who works in the field of CyberSecurity, has taught me a lot about computers. He has also taught me many different coding languages, such as JavaScript and Python. Some other languages I found very interesting were HTML and CSS, the 2 major languages I used to build this entire webpage, and I taught myself how to use them. When it comes to jobs, I hope to possibly land a position in the field of technology in the future. This section basically explains my goals and interests. Thanks for reading this, and if you want to know even more about me, check out the other pages in this website!
